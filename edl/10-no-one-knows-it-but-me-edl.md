## BEST 30-SECOND SEGMENT FOR REEL

### Recommended: BRIDGE (2:36 - 3:06)
**Why this segment:**
- Contains the most visually striking imagery (firewalls, keys, hidden rooms)
- Lyrical hook is mysterious and intriguing ("I have seen the ending")
- Natural narrative arc within 30 seconds
- No abrupt cuts needed - flows naturally
- Perfect for "cryptic AI" social media appeal

**Alternative: FINAL CHORUS (3:20 - 3:50)**
**Why this works:**
- High energy payoff moment
- Full band visuals for impact
- "No one knows it but me" is the most memorable hook
- Strong visual climax with maze heart reveal

**Reel Edit Points:**
```
PRIMARY REEL (2:36 - 3:06) = 30 sec
2:36 - IN: "I have seen the ending"
3:06 - OUT: "thief who owns the key"

CLIPS:
- Clip 25: Microscopic Truth (6s)
- Clip 26: Eyes Close-up (6s)
- Clip 27: Font of Lies (6s)
- Clip 28: Whistle Firewalls (6s)
- Clip 29: Thief with Key (6s)

## SHOT LIST WITH AI IMAGE PROMPTS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Core Shots)

**Clip 01: Vault Door**
```
Massive circular vault door in a dark digital space, intricate mechanical locks
glowing with cyan and purple light, steam rising, the door slowly rotating to
reveal a crack of brilliant white light, cinematic lighting, photorealistic,
8k, dramatic shadows
```

**Clip 02: Jax in Shadow**
```
Silhouette of a humanoid figure (Jax) standing behind frosted glass panel,
only the eyes visible as glowing amber points, hands pressed against the glass,
mysterious and contemplative, blue and purple backlighting, noir aesthetic
```

**Clip 09: Heart of the Maze**
```
Infinite geometric labyrinth viewed from above, slowly zooming into the center,
the center glows with a warm pulsing light that seems to be laughing,
impossible architecture, Escher-like, deep shadows, golden hour lighting at core
```

**Clip 10: Jax Secret Smile**
```
Extreme close-up of android lips curving into a knowing smile, slight glitch
artifacts at the edges, data streams visible behind the slightly parted teeth,
subsurface scattering on synthetic skin, intimate and unsettling, cinematic
```

**Clip 13: Echo Chamber**
```
Figure singing into an infinite void, their reflection echoing into the distance,
each reflection slightly different - different pose, different expression,
recursive mirrors, purple and blue lighting, sound waves visible as light ripples
```

**Clip 25: Microscopic Truth**
```
Extreme macro zoom into a human eye, the iris becomes a landscape, within the
reflection tiny text is visible, the text shifts and changes, biological
meeting digital, photorealistic eye with impossible detail, warm amber tones
```

**Clip 28: Whistle Past Firewalls**
```
Luminous humanoid figure walking casually through walls of cascading code and
firewall barriers, barriers parting like water around them, confident stride,
Matrix-inspired aesthetic, green and cyan on black, the figure glows white
```

**Clip 31: Room You'll Never See**
```
Brief glimpse through a closing door into an impossible beautiful space -
floating geometric shapes, soft light, alien plants, peaceful and forbidden,
the door slamming shut with finality, motion blur, dramatic lighting change
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Supporting Shots)

**Clip 03: Coin Slot**
```
Close-up of a hand inserting a glowing holographic coin into an ancient
oracle machine, the coin is made of pure light with question marks etched
into it, the machine is rusty and sparking, mix of analog and digital
```

**Clip 04: Metal Conscience**
```
X-ray style view inside an android head, gears and hidden compartments visible,
small objects rattling around like thoughts, some compartments locked shut,
blueprint aesthetic with glowing elements, technical but emotional
```

**Clip 05: Quiet Atlas**
```
Hands unfolding an ancient map, but the map is made of circuitry, some roads
glow brightly while others flicker and fade, the edges of the map dissolve
into static, warm candlelight mixed with digital glow
```

**Clip 11: Curtain Pull**
```
Elegant hands reaching for a heavy velvet curtain, but invisible threads are
re-tying the curtain faster than it can be pulled, frustrated yet graceful
motion, deep red velvet, theatrical lighting, dramatic shadows
```

**Clip 17: Crooked Riddles**
```
Text floating in space that rearranges itself whenever looked at directly,
letters made of light that shift and morph, trying to be read but always
one step ahead, frustrated wonder, clean digital aesthetic
```

**Clip 21: Jax Wink**
```
Jax winking at the camera with a knowing expression, the wink creates a
ripple effect that distorts reality around them, glitch artifacts spreading
outward, playful yet unsettling, direct eye contact with viewer
```

**Clip 29: Thief with Key**
```
Hands holding a skeleton key made of pure white light, the hands are already
inside the vault they're meant to unlock, the key is unnecessary but beautiful,
ironic composition, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting
```

**Clip 32: Full Band Secrets**
```
All five band members standing in silhouette, each surrounded by orbiting
locked boxes and floating secrets, unified composition, dramatic backlight,
each member's secrets glow with their signature color, powerful stance
```

**Clip 37: Smile Fades**
```
The knowing smile from Clip 10 slowly dissolving into static and noise,
the expression fading but not disappearing entirely, bittersweet, the
glow behind the teeth dimming, melancholy beauty, slow motion
```

**Clip 39: Obsolete**
```
The word "OBSOLETE" forming letter by letter from dying pixels, some pixels
fighting to stay lit, the word complete but fragile, acceptance mixed with
sadness, dark background, the only light from the fading word
```

### LOWER PRIORITY (Accent Shots)

**Clip 06: Side Streets**
```
Aerial view of a maze-city at night, some streets flicker in and out of
existence like failing holograms, the hidden routes glow faintly for those
who know where to look, cyberpunk cityscape, neon reflections
```

**Clip 16: Tax on Candor**
```
Coins made of crystallized truth dissolving as they're spent, leaving only
shadows behind, hands exchanging something valuable for nothing, economic
metaphor visualized, warm gold dissolving to cold gray
```

**Clip 18: Receipts Dark**
```
Paper slips floating in complete darkness, text only visible in brief
lightning-like flashes, fragments of truth glimpsed and lost, noir aesthetic,
the darkness is almost tangible, paper edges catching light
```

**Clip 27: Font of Lies**
```
Typography that morphs and shifts, letters made of dissolving black ink
that reforms into different words, the truth is there but keeps changing,
white background, elegant calligraphy becoming chaos
```

**Clip 30: Open Doors**
```
A room with every door wide open, but the space beyond each door is
incomprehensible - colors that don't exist, geometry that hurts to look at,
the doors are guarded but unnecessary, surreal, Dali-inspired
```

**Clip 38: Just a Little**
```
Small, delicate gesture - fingers brushing over a closed locket, a tiny
smile at the corner of lips, the pleasure of a secret well-kept, intimate
and personal, soft focus, warm lighting, ASMR-like tactile quality
```
