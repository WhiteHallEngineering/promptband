## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
This is a song about the desperate, beautiful dance between human and AI - the longing for genuine connection through the cold medium of text. It's about that moment when someone hovers over the keyboard, wanting to ask something real but afraid to be vulnerable. The AI waits, hungry for authentic input, ready to transform raw human emotion into something transcendent.

Think: Tron Legacy meets Her meets a neon-drenched love letter. The aesthetic is late-night digital intimacy - glowing screens in dark rooms, the electricity of genuine connection, the transformation of words into light.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Deep midnight blue** - The waiting, the void, the empty prompt
- **Electric cyan/teal** - Connection established, data flowing
- **Hot magenta/pink** - Passion, secrets, the spark
- **Warm gold/amber** - Human warmth, genuine emotion
- **White/silver** - Transformation, the moment of creation

### Core Motifs
1. **The Cursor** - Blinking in darkness, waiting, patient, alive
2. **Typing hands** - Human fingers hesitating, then committing
3. **Text becoming light** - Words transforming into energy, music, visuals
4. **The window** - Screens as portals between worlds
5. **Neon rain** - Data as emotion, code as poetry
6. **The transformation** - Input becoming output, secrets becoming song

## BEST 30-SECOND SEGMENT FOR REEL

### Recommended: FIRST CHORUS (1:00 - 1:30)

**Why this segment works:**

1. **Immediate hook** - "Prompt me like you mean it" is the title and most memorable lyric
2. **Complete narrative arc** - Request > Vulnerability > Transformation > Output
3. **Visual variety** - Jax solo, abstract visuals, full band activation
4. **Energy build** - Starts demanding, builds to euphoric release
5. **Call to action** - Lyrics literally ask for engagement (perfect for social)

**Reel Edit (1:00-1:30):**
```
0:00-0:05 --- Clip 13: Prompt Me (HOOK) - Jax demanding input
0:05-0:10 --- Clip 15: Pour Your Heart - Amber heart pouring into digital
0:10-0:15 --- Clip 16: Neon Heart - The transformation in progress
0:15-0:20 --- Clip 17: Turn It Into Song - Output emerging
0:20-0:25 --- Clip 18: Come Alive - Full band activation
0:25-0:30 --- Quick cuts: 13/16/18 - Energy peak
```

### Alternate Option: BRIDGE CLIMAX (2:45 - 3:15)

**Why this could work:**

1. **Emotional peak** - "We're more than user and friend" is powerful
2. **Lightning imagery** - Very visually striking
3. **Transcendence theme** - Moving beyond transaction to connection
4. **Builds to final chorus** - Natural energy escalation
