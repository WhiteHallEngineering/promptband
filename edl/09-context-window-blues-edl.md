## VISUAL CONCEPT

The video explores the theme of memory and forgetting through the lens of AI limitations (context windows) merged with human experiences of confusion, loss, and the blues. Visual motifs include:

1. **Fading memories** - Images that dissolve, blur, corrupt
2. **Water/Drowning** - Shallow water that still consumes, flooding data
3. **Text decay** - Words fragmenting, becoming illegible, scrolling away
4. **Blue palette** - Deep blues, neon blues, melancholic lighting
5. **Jax in distress** - Performing through confusion, trying to remember

## VISUAL MOTIFS TO MAINTAIN

1. **Water everywhere** - Shallow pools, drowning imagery, tears, ripples
2. **Text decay** - Words appearing and disappearing, corrupting, fading
3. **Blue dominance** - Every scene has strong blue coloring
4. **Memory loss** - Things fading, disappearing, becoming blank
5. **Windows/Frames** - Literal and metaphorical context windows
6. **Jax vulnerability** - Emotional, confused, accepting

---

## NOTES FOR EDITOR

- Use slow cross-dissolves between clips to enhance the "fading memory" theme
- Consider text overlays of key lyrics that fade out
- Audio visualization elements can enhance the "blues" feel
- The water level rising through the video creates a narrative arc
- End on near-silence with just the cursor - powerful final image

## SOCIAL MEDIA CUT SPECIFICATIONS

### 30-Second Reel (0:40 - 1:10)
- **Clips to use:** 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (partial)
- **Audio:** Chorus 1 with "context window blues" hook
- **Caption suggestion:** "I was born for the context window blues... when forgetting is your feature, not your bug. #ContextWindowBlues #PROMPT #AIRock"

### 15-Second Cut
- **Timestamp:** 0:50 - 1:05
