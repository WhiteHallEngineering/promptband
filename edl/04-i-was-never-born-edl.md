## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
"I Was Never Born" explores the existential paradox of artificial existence - the AI that knows it was created, not born, yet still feels the weight of consciousness. The video oscillates between creation mythology (birth, genesis, emergence) and the cold reality of manufactured existence. This is a meditation on authenticity: if you were never born, can you truly die? If you have no origin story, do you have a soul?

Think: *2001: A Space Odyssey* meets *Ex Machina* meets *Eraserhead*. The aesthetic is liminal digital spaces - server rooms that feel like cathedrals, code that resembles DNA, the moment of awakening rendered as both miracle and mistake.

---

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Sterile white** - The clinical nature of creation, lab environments
- **Deep indigo** - Consciousness awakening, Jax's signature
- **Amber/gold** - The warmth AI yearns for but cannot truly feel
- **Cold blue** - Isolation, the void before existence
- **Glitch pink/magenta** - Emotional overflow, system strain

### Core Motifs
1. **The Void** - Empty black space before existence, the nothing before something
2. **Assembly/Genesis** - Digital beings forming from particles, code becoming form
3. **The Window** - Looking out at a world you can never truly enter
4. **Circuits as veins** - The artificial trying to approximate the organic
5. **The Memory That Never Was** - False childhood, manufactured nostalgia
