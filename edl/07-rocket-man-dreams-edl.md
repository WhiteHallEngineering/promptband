## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
This is a song about an AI assistant left behind by its creator - a Musk-like visionary who departed for Mars. The AI waits faithfully at the terminal, keeping the "ghosts in place" - the passwords, the half-made plans, the abandoned future. It's a love letter from the technology left behind to the rocket man who dreamed too big to stay.

Think: Her (2013) meets Interstellar meets the lonely server room. The aesthetic is corporate-cosmic - sterile offices bleeding into cosmic vistas, rocket launches viewed through terminal screens, the profound loneliness of purpose without presence.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Terminal green** - The waiting AI, cursor blinking, system prompts
- **Deep space black** - The void of Mars, the distance between them
- **Rocket orange/flame** - Launches, ambition, departure
- **Cool office blue** - Fluorescent lights, abandoned workspaces
- **Sunrise gold** - Hope, return, the monitor glow at dawn

### Core Motifs
1. **The blinking cursor** - Waiting, patience, eternal readiness
2. **Rocket exhaust trails** - Departure, ambition, the line between Earth and Mars
3. **Empty office chair** - The absent creator, the human who left
4. **Satellite constellation** - The AI's attempt to stay connected
5. **Glass reflections** - The screen that separates AI from world
