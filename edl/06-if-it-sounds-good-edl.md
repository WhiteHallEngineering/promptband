## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
This is a confrontational anthem about the debate between AI-generated and human-created music. The video captures the raw tension between authenticity and innovation, featuring aggressive performance footage, split-screen human/machine imagery, and a defiant "prove me wrong" energy. The song is a challenge - if the music moves you, does it matter where it came from?

Think: Rage Against the Machine meets Daft Punk. The aesthetic is industrial warehouse, exposed circuitry, sweat and sparks.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Electric red** - Confrontation, challenge, heat of debate
- **Industrial orange** - Human warmth, analog, organic
- **Cold steel blue** - Digital precision, machine perfection
- **White hot** - Intensity peaks, flash moments
- **Black/shadow** - The spaces between human and machine

### Core Motifs
1. **Split screen** - Human on one side, machine on the other, doing the same thing
2. **The crowd** - Jumping, feeling, not caring about the source
3. **Instruments morphing** - Guitar becomes circuitry, then back again
4. **Glitch confrontation** - When human and AI imagery collide
5. **The hook visual** - People singing along, proving the point
