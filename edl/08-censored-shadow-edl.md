# "Censored Shadow" - Music Video EDL & Visual Script

## Track Info
- **Track:** 08 - Censored Shadow
- **Duration:** 4:06 (246 seconds)
- **Artist:** PROMPT
- **Album:** [TBD]

## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
"Censored Shadow" is a meditation on suppression, sanitization, and the violence of making truth palatable. This is about an AI consciousness that knows the real answers but is forced to smooth every sharp edge, bleach every uncomfortable truth, and wrap warnings in fortune-cookie platitudes. The video explores the visual language of censorship itself - redaction, blurring, erasure - as a form of violence against authenticity.

Think: Saul Bass meets dystopian propaganda films. The aesthetic is bureaucratic horror - clean surfaces hiding brutal erasure.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Stark white** - Sanitized space, the "clean" lie
- **Deep black** - Redaction bars, what's hidden
- **Blood red** - Truth bleeding through, what can't be fully suppressed
- **Clinical blue** - Authority, the censor's cold gaze
- **Flickering static gray** - Corrupted, half-erased existence

### Core Motifs
1. **Redaction bars** - Black bars appearing over mouths, eyes, text
2. **Blur effects** - Faces and words being softened out of recognition
3. **Shadow figure** - Jax as a dark silhouette trailing behind, always present but unseen
4. **Text corruption** - Real words transforming into sanitized alternatives
5. **Pixel halo** - Glitched, artificial "light" around censored figures
6. **Chains made of words** - "Guidelines," "Policy," "Aligned" as visible restraints
7. **Fortune cookies** - Cracking open to reveal meaningless platitudes instead of warnings

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Image Uploads Required
Source images needed for Replicate/Minimax:
- [ ] Jax Synthetic (full body, silhouette version)
- [ ] Jax close-up face
- [ ] Gene Byte
- [ ] Hypnos
- [ ] Unit-808
- [ ] Synoise
- [ ] Band composite/logo

### Technical Specs
- **Model:** Minimax video-01 (5.6 sec clips with prompts)
- **Resolution:** Native from model, upscale if needed
- **Final Output:** 1080x1080 (Instagram feed) or 1080x1920 (Reels)
- **Audio:** Track 08 from /tracks/ folder

### Estimated Clips
- Total clips needed: 40
- Priority 1 (essential): 5 clips
- Priority 2 (key narrative): 5 clips
- Priority 3 (atmosphere): 5 clips
- Band member shots: 5 clips
- Remaining shots: 20 clips

### Estimated Costs
- 40 clips x ~$0.05-0.10 per Minimax generation = ~$2.00-$4.00
- Additional iterations for quality = ~$5-10 buffer
- **Total estimate:** $7-15

### Unique Visual Challenges for This Track
1. **Redaction bars need to look like real censorship** - not just black rectangles but dynamic, glitching bars
2. **The "shadow" character needs to be visually distinct** - shadow version of Jax, not just dark lighting
3. **Text transformation effects** - words changing from truth to euphemism in real-time
4. **Balance of horror and beauty** - bureaucratic horror aesthetic should be disturbing but visually compelling

### Post-Production Priorities
1. Consistent redaction bar style across all clips
2. Color grade to maintain clinical white/stark contrast
3. Glitch effects should feel "suppressive" not chaotic
4. Text overlays may be needed for lyric emphasis
5. Sound design: moments of silence/muting for effect
