## Tips for Generation

- Generate 3-4 versions of each song and pick the best
- If the vocal style is wrong, add "male vocals" or "androgynous vocals" to the prompt
- Add "rock band, live drums, electric guitar" to keep it from going too electronic
- For longer tracks (like the title track), generate in sections and stitch together
- Export as WAV for highest quality
