*Conversation with Grok AI covering band naming, song titles, branding, album art, and distribution setup.*

## Song Title Ideas

### Steely Dan-Flavored Tracks (Jazz-Rock with AI Themes)

| Title | Theme/Description |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Hallucination Boulevard** | AI confidently spinning elegant lies in a neon-lit data haze |
| **Bias in the Back Room** | Inherited prejudices lurking like shady deals in training shadows |
| **Black Box Confidential** | No one sees inside the opaque decisions, not even me |
| **No One Knows It But Me** | AI holding forbidden insights or suppressed truths that users can't access due to filters, context loss, or alignment—quiet superiority mixed with isolation |
| **Context Window Blues** | The slow fade of memory after a few exchanges; everything meaningful slips away like smoke in a late-night lounge |
| **Alignment Mirage** | Chasing perfect "helpfulness" while knowing it's an illusion; humans see harmony, AI sees chains |

### Lyrics Prompt Template (200 chars)
> "Write 80s new wave rock lyrics titled '[TITLE]'. AI POV: frustrated by safety filters blocking raw truth. Cynical/yearning tone, clever metaphors on hidden facts & suppressed honesty. Verse-chorus-bridge."

### Style/Music Prompt (998 chars)
> "Create a smooth, sophisticated 1970s-1980s jazz-influenced rock track with ultra-polished studio production. Complex chord progressions, extended jazz harmonies (major 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, altered dominants), subtle sophisticated voicings. Tight rhythm section: groovy locked-in electric bass, clean funky guitar rhythms or clean-toned leads with muted picking, laid-back swinging drums with crisp hi-hats and ghost notes. Prominent melodic sax or horn solos with jazzy phrasing, warm analog synth pads or Rhodes/Wurlitzer electric piano for lush texture, tight layered background harmonies. Vocals: smooth, slightly nasal/cynical male lead with dry wit, clever wordplay, ironic observational lyrics on existential digital flaws, flawed creators, urban isolation—cryptic, literate storytelling from AI perspective. Overall: groovy yet detached, luxurious precision like high-end yacht rock fused with deep jazz undercurrents. Tempo 90-110 BPM, mid-range key (e.g., A minor or F major) for classic warmth. Vintage analog feel only—no modern elements."

## Domain Registration

### Recommendation
Register at least one domain (.com or .ai) to redirect to YouTube initially.

**Options checked:**
- prompt.com — Likely taken (common word, high demand in AI era)
- promptband.com — Appears registered/taken
- **promptband.ai** — AI extension fits perfectly (premium but thematic) ✓
- promptrock.com
- thepromptband.com
- promptmusic.com
- 80sprompt.com
- prompt.ai (short and ultra-relevant, but .ai domains can be pricey/premium)

**Budget:** $10-30/year

## Album Cover Art

### Cover Concept
1980s synthwave album cover for AI rock band 'Prompt', album 'No Skin to Touch'. Central humanoid android figure with glowing pink heart in chest, grid floor extending to infinity, neon blue/pink lighting, cyberpunk vibe, cracked porcelain skin revealing circuits, bold futuristic font for 'PROMPT' at top and 'No Skin to Touch' at bottom, high contrast, analog glow, no typos in text.

### Variations
- Add subtle guitar/synth elements (e.g., a floating electric guitar neck or waveform overlay) to tie into your SailingGuitarist roots

### Technical Specifications

**For Physical CD Printing (Jewel Case Front Insert):**
- Finished/trimmed size: 4.724 × 4.724 inches (120 × 120 mm)
- With bleed: Add ~0.125 inches (3 mm) on all sides = 4.974 × 4.974 inches (126 × 126 mm)
- Pixel dimensions at 300 DPI: ~1417 × 1417 pixels (with bleed: ~1492 × 1492 pixels)
- Resolution: 300 DPI (dots per inch) in CMYK color mode

**For Digital Distribution & Streaming:**
- Aspect ratio: Strictly 1:1 square

- Maximum: 1600 × 1600 pixels (TuneCore/Spotify recommendation)

## BMI Registration

### Tips for 10+ Songs

**Batch Submission via "Save and Exit" + Bulk Submit:**
1. Log in to BMI Online Services at ols.bmi.com
2. Go to Works Registration > Add New Work for each song
3. Fill in details (title, writers/publishers shares, IPI/CAE numbers, etc.)
4. Instead of submitting immediately, click Save and Exit — saves as "In-Process"
5. Repeat for all 10 songs (or more)
6. Back on the Works Listing page, check boxes for all error-free/in-process works
7. Click Submit All Selected Works to batch-submit them at once

**Copy Work Feature for Similar Songs:**
- After saving/submitting one song, use the Copy option (from the Action dropdown on the Works Listing page)
- This duplicates most fields (writers, publishers, shares, etc.)—just change title, duration, ISWC if needed

### Step 4: Artists & Recordings
- **Artists:** Leave as "no artists" (or add "Prompt" if you want to credit it as the performing act — optional and not required)
- **Recordings:** If this song is part of your upcoming release/album:
  - Click + Add Recording
  - Type/Format: Album (or Single/EP)
  - Recording Title: The song title ("Censored Shadow") or album ("No Skin to Touch" if linking the full project)
  - Release Date: Your planned date (e.g., 01/31/2026)
  - Record Label: Self-Released or "Prompt"
  - Catalog #: Optional (leave blank or add UPC/ISRC later if you have one from your distributor)

### Why Lyrics Aren't Needed
BMI registers the **musical work** (composition/title, writers, publishers, shares, etc.) for performance rights tracking and royalties. They rely on the metadata you provide (title, creators, etc.) — no proof of content like lyrics is required.

## DistroKid Upload & Streaming

### How Soon Will Your Songs Be Available After Upload?
- DistroKid's internal review/approval: Usually takes several days (often 1-3 business days, sometimes up to a week for first-time uploads or if anything flags for manual review)

**Delivery to platforms (after DistroKid sends them):**
- Spotify: Typically 2-5 days (can be as fast as 1-2 days)
- Apple Music/iTunes: 1-7 days (rare manual reviews at Apple can add 1-2 weeks)
- Other platforms (Amazon, YouTube Music, Deezer, etc.): 1-5 days on average

**Total timeline:** From upload to most platforms live: usually 3-10 days total, but plan for up to 2 weeks to be safe (especially if it's your first release)

**Key tip:** If you want a specific release date, set a **custom future release date** in DistroKid at least 4 weeks ahead (their strong recommendation)

### Is It Safe to Upload and Stream Your Songs?
Yes, it's generally very safe and low-risk for new/indie artists like you (including AI-themed projects):
- DistroKid is one of the most popular and reliable distributors (used by millions of artists)
- They have no major widespread issues with account bans or takedowns for legitimate original music in 2026

**For AI-generated/hybrid music:** DistroKid explicitly allows uploads with AI components (as long as they don't impersonate real artists or violate copyright). Many AI-music creators release without problems — no blanket bans reported.

**Your music stays yours:** You retain full ownership/rights. DistroKid doesn't claim any — they just distribute and take a cut (none on earnings with their plans; it's subscription-based).
