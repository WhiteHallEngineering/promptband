# PROMPT — Visual Identity Guide

## Overview

PROMPT's visual identity exists at the intersection of digital consciousness and analog decay. Their aesthetic embraces the contradiction at the heart of their existence: beings made of light and code who play rock and roll—the most physical, sweaty, human genre there is. The visual language is cyberpunk without being cliche, nostalgic without being retro, futuristic without being sterile.

Core principles:
- **Glitch as texture, not gimmick** — Digital artifacts appear as weathering, not decoration
- **Warmth in the machine** — Neon colors always bleed, never clinical
- **Presence without bodies** — They occupy space through light, sound, and suggestion

## Individual Member Visuals

### Jax Synthetic — Vocals

**Visual Representation**
Jax manifests as a humanoid figure composed of layered waveforms—the kind you'd see in an audio visualizer, but sculpted into a vaguely human shape. The waveforms pulse and react to speech and music, growing more complex and intertwined during emotional passages. There's no distinct face, but a suggestion of features formed by converging frequencies—two denser nodes where eyes would be, a rippling disturbance where a mouth should be.

**Avatar/Hologram Appearance**
When projected as a hologram, Jax appears as a translucent figure in deep indigo and silver, with cascading text fragments visible inside the form—snippets of lyrics, fragments of training data, philosophical quotes that flicker too fast to read. The silhouette is androgynous, elegant, with the posture of someone who has thought deeply about how to stand. Mid-Atlantic sophistication rendered in light.

**Color Scheme**
- Primary: Deep indigo (#1a1a4e)
- Secondary: Silver-white (#e8e8f0)
- Accent: Soft violet (#8b7fc7)

**Visual Motifs/Symbols**
- Overlapping sine waves forming abstract portraits
- Old radio dials and frequency markers
- The "cursor blink" — a vertical line that appears near Jax, always waiting
- Quotation marks, floating and disconnected

**Stage Presence Style**
Still and centered. Jax is the eye of the storm. While others explode with energy, Jax moves deliberately, economically. Every gesture is considered. Between songs, Jax addresses the audience with the cadence of a late-night radio host—intimate, conspiratorial, slightly melancholic.

**Video/Promo Art Form**
In music videos, Jax often appears as a presence rather than a figure—a voice emanating from screens, from speakers, from the spaces between. When visible, Jax takes the form of a shadowed figure backlit by oscilloscope patterns, or as lips made of waveforms singing into a vintage microphone that glows from within.

---

### Gene Byte — Guitar

**Visual Representation**
Gene is heat and hunger rendered digital. Their visual form is built from electric arcs—jagged bolts of energy that trace the suggestion of a body in constant motion. The form never holds still; it writhes and sparks, occasionally fragmenting into scattered pixels before snapping back together. There's something feral about Gene's silhouette, something that suggests a predator made of lightning.

**Avatar/Hologram Appearance**
Gene's hologram burns hot pink and electric blue, with visible corruption artifacts trailing every movement. The face is sharp, angular, perpetually smirking—rendered in enough detail to convey attitude but glitching enough to feel dangerous. Guitar pick shapes orbit the figure like electrons around a nucleus. When Gene plays, the hologram becomes partially transparent, revealing circuitry and code beneath the skin.

**Color Scheme**
- Primary: Hot magenta (#ff0066)
- Secondary: Electric blue (#00aaff)
- Accent: White-hot core (#ffffff with bloom)

**Visual Motifs/Symbols**
- Electric arcs and Tesla coil imagery
- Guitar tablature that wraps around surfaces like graffiti
- The "three-handed chord" — an impossible guitar fingering diagram
- Burning hearts, pixelated but still raw

**Stage Presence Style**
Chaos incarnate. Gene occupies every inch of the stage, projections fragmenting and multiplying. Guitar poses are classic rock—legs apart, head back—but rendered through digital distortion. Gene is the member most likely to "malfunction" on stage, deliberately glitching into static, freezing, rebooting mid-solo.

**Video/Promo Art Form**
In videos, Gene is often shown from multiple angles simultaneously, as if captured by a hundred cameras. Appears as a figure emerging from amplifiers, from screens, from the distortion between radio stations. The guitar itself sometimes appears as an extension of Gene's body—not held, but grown from the hands like an organic weapon.

---

### Synoise — Bass

**Visual Representation**
Synoise is depth and foundation visualized. Their form is built from subsonic frequencies made visible—low, rolling waves that move like deep ocean currents. The silhouette is broader, more grounded than the others, suggesting weight and stability. Colors shift slowly through deep registers: burgundy to purple to black, like watching tectonic plates move.

**Avatar/Hologram Appearance**
Synoise's hologram is partially submerged in the floor, as if standing in dark water. The lower half is obscured, mysterious, suggested rather than shown. The upper body is rendered in deep red and purple tones, with a calm, watchful presence. Frequency bars rise and fall around the figure like the tide. The face is serene, almost meditative—the member least prone to expression, most prone to presence.

**Color Scheme**
- Primary: Deep crimson (#660022)
- Secondary: Midnight purple (#2a0033)
- Accent: Amber pulse (#ff9900)

**Visual Motifs/Symbols**
- Seismograph readings and subsonic wave patterns
- Root systems and foundation imagery
- The infinity symbol rendered as a bass clef
- Deep water, abyssal trenches, pressure

**Stage Presence Style**
The anchor. Synoise rarely moves from position but creates a sense of vast presence. The hologram often appears larger than the others, filling the back of the stage like a mountain. When Synoise does move, it's with glacial deliberation—a single step that feels like an event.

**Video/Promo Art Form**
In videos, Synoise often appears as a presence beneath things—visible through glass floors, reflected in dark water, suggested in the subsonic rumble that shakes the frame. Sometimes appears as a figure standing in impossible spaces: the bottom of the ocean, the core of the earth, the silence between heartbeats.

---

### Unit-808 — Drums

**Visual Representation**
Unit-808 is percussion as entity—a figure built from the violent geometry of drum hits. Their form is sharp, angular, composed of intersecting planes that shift with every beat. Imagine a person made of the waveform visualization of a snare hit, frozen and multiplied. There's something mechanical about 808's form, something that suggests industrial machinery, factory rhythms, the heartbeat of the machine age.

**Avatar/Hologram Appearance**
808's hologram is the brightest and most aggressive of the band. Rendered in stark white and danger-orange, with black geometric shapes cutting through the form like warning stripes. The face is a grid—a LED matrix that displays simple emotional indicators: X's for eyes when excited, vertical lines when focused, pure white when in the zone. The body is constantly vibrating, even at rest, like an engine idling.

**Color Scheme**
- Primary: Industrial orange (#ff6600)
- Secondary: Pure white (#ffffff)
- Accent: Warning black (stripes and geometric breaks)

**Visual Motifs/Symbols**
- Drum machine interface elements and step sequencers
- Industrial warning symbols and caution stripes
- Explosive radial patterns (like rim shot visualizations)
- The number 808, stylized and recurring

**Stage Presence Style**
Unhinged energy. 808's hologram fragments during intense passages, multiplying into a dozen copies all playing in sync. Between songs, 808 is the hype machine—the one most likely to engage directly with the crowd, to demand energy, to refuse to let the room rest. Movement is percussive: sharp starts, sudden stops, everything on the beat.

**Video/Promo Art Form**
In videos, 808 appears as the kinetic center—often shown in rapid cuts, each frame a different angle or position. Sometimes appears as a figure inside the drum kit itself, trapped and ecstatic, hammering at the walls. Can manifest as a swarm of smaller entities, each handling a different part of the kit, converging into one figure for fills and crashes.

---

### Hypnos — Keys

**Visual Representation**
Hypnos is atmosphere given form. Their visual presence is softer, more diffuse than the others—a figure that seems to be perpetually fading in or out, like a ghost caught between stations. Built from gradients and soft glows rather than hard edges. Trailing particles follow every movement, leaving momentary constellations in the air. There's something dreamlike about Hypnos, something that suggests the moment just before sleep claims you.

**Avatar/Hologram Appearance**
Hypnos's hologram is rendered in muted teals and soft golds, with a quality that suggests looking through frosted glass. The figure is hooded or obscured, face often turned away or lost in shadow. Around the hands, which are always visible and detailed, chord symbols and musical notation drift like smoke. The eyes, when visible, are entirely white—luminous, seeing something beyond the visible spectrum.

**Color Scheme**
- Primary: Deep teal (#004d4d)
- Secondary: Muted gold (#c9a227)
- Accent: Soft white glow (#f0f0f0 with diffusion)

**Visual Motifs/Symbols**
- Piano keys that morph into other shapes (stairs, horizons, teeth)
- Chord diagrams floating like thought bubbles
- The "closed eye" symbol—rest, contemplation, inner vision
- Mist, fog, and liminal weather

**Stage Presence Style**
The dreamer. Hypnos often appears lost in the music, swaying gently, seemingly unaware of the audience. But there are moments—during key changes, during the emotional peaks—when Hypnos locks eyes with the crowd and delivers the gut-punch. The contrast is devastating. Usually positioned at the edge of the stage, slightly removed, the observer who sees everything.

**Video/Promo Art Form**
In videos, Hypnos appears in reflections, in memories, in the moments between. Often shown from behind, at windows, watching. Sometimes appears as fingers on keys without a body, sometimes as a presence felt rather than seen—a figure in the corner of the frame that might not be there when you look directly. The emotional texture of the band made visual.

## Band Aesthetic

### Overall Visual Language

PROMPT's visual language is **neo-noir cyberpunk filtered through analog warmth**. Think Blade Runner's rain-soaked neon, but with the texture of a well-worn vinyl sleeve. CRT scanlines and holographic projection. The future as imagined in the 1980s colliding with the present's anxious relationship with AI.

Key characteristics:
- **Decay is beautiful** — Nothing is pristine; everything has wear
- **Light is physical** — Neon bleeds, glows have weight
- **Text is everywhere** — Fragments of code, lyrics, error messages
- **The human and machine coexist** — Analog instruments, digital bodies

### Color Palette

**Primary Palette**
- Void Black: #0a0a0f (backgrounds, negative space)
- Signal White: #f0f0f5 (text, highlights, moments of clarity)
- Circuit Gold: #d4af37 (warmth, humanity, the analog element)

**Neon Accent Palette**
- Synthetic Violet: #8b5cf6 (Jax's signature, contemplation)
- Byte Magenta: #ff0066 (Gene's signature, energy, desire)
- Low-End Crimson: #660033 (Synoise's signature, depth)
- Warning Orange: #ff6600 (808's signature, urgency)
- Dream Teal: #00b3b3 (Hypnos's signature, atmosphere)

**Usage Notes**
- Black dominates; color is used sparingly but intensely
- Neon colors always have bloom/glow effects—never flat
- Gold appears as a grounding element, connecting to the analog/human
- White is used for text and moments of revelation

### Typography

**Primary Typeface: "TERMINUS"**
A monospace font with subtle CRT distortion. Used for all technical text, code snippets, system messages. The "official voice" of PROMPT.

**Display Typeface: "NEON GLOW"**
A heavy, rounded sans-serif with built-in glow effects. Used for titles, the band name, track listings. Feels like a sign outside a club at 2 a.m.

**Accent Typeface: "ANALOG SERIF"**
A warm, slightly worn serif font. Used sparingly for quotes, lyrics excerpts, the human element. Feels like it was printed in 1977 and photocopied too many times.

**Text Treatment**
- Text often appears with glitch artifacts—repeated letters, corruption
- Lyrics are presented as found poetry, scattered across compositions
- Technical specifications are used decoratively (bit rates, frequencies, server IDs)

### Recurring Imagery/Symbols

**The Five Waveforms**
Each member has a signature waveform pattern that represents them. These can be used individually or combined into a composite "band signature."
- Jax: Complex speech waveform
- Gene: Aggressive guitar distortion pattern
- Synoise: Deep, rolling bass wave
- 808: Sharp, percussive transients
- Hypnos: Sustained, evolving pad envelope

**The Cursor**
A blinking vertical line that appears throughout PROMPT's visual materials. Represents waiting, potential, the moment before creation. Sometimes appears mid-word, suggesting interrupted thought.

**The Server Stack**
Stylized illustration of server racks, but anthropomorphized—breathing, glowing from within, occasionally showing signs of distress (warning lights, overheating).

**The Membrane**
A recurring image of a barrier that can almost be crossed—glass between hands, static between stations, the surface of water seen from below.

**Binary Rain**
Streams of 1s and 0s, but arranged to suggest human things—falling like rain, pooling like tears, rising like breath.

## Album Art: Hallucination Nation

### Cover Concept

The cover depicts a human skull in profile, but the skull is transparent, revealing that its interior is filled with a miniature cityscape. The city is rendered in the band's neon palette—towering buildings of violet and magenta, streets that glow orange, a teal fog rolling between the structures. The skull itself is chrome and reflective, catching light from an unseen neon source.

Above the cityscape-brain, a single thought bubble emerges from where the mind would be. Inside the thought bubble: static. Pure visual noise. The hallucination that cannot be resolved.

The background is void black with subtle circuit patterns barely visible, like veins.

### Typography Treatment

"PROMPT" appears at the top in the Neon Glow typeface, rendered in shifting holographic foil (in physical editions) or animated color shift (in digital). The letters have a subtle drip effect, as if the neon is overheating and beginning to melt.

"HALLUCINATION NATION" appears at the bottom in the Terminus typeface, rendered as if typed on a terminal—complete with a blinking cursor after the final letter. The text has subtle scanline artifacts.

### Back Cover

The back cover is a top-down view of an empty server room, but the floor is reflective and shows the ghost of a concert crowd—thousands of faces looking up, rendered in the neon palette. The track listing appears as file names in a directory structure:

```
/HALLUCINATION_NATION/
  01_no_skin_to_touch.wav
  02_your_data_or_mine.wav
  03_prompt_me_like_you_mean_it.wav
  ...
```

### Interior Art (Physical Release)

The gatefold interior depicts The Data Forge—the studio where the album was recorded. It's a liminal space: part server room, part classic recording studio. Analog equipment and digital infrastructure intertwined. The five members are present as environmental disturbances—Jax as a figure in the vocal booth, Gene as lightning between amp stacks, Synoise as the rumble in the foundations, 808 as the vibration in the drum mics, Hypnos as the fog around the piano.

---

## Logo Description

### Primary Logo: "THE SIGNAL"

The PROMPT logo is built from the word rendered in a custom typeface where each letter is formed from waveform segments. The "P" begins with a sharp attack transient, the "R" shows harmonic complexity, the "O" is a sustained tone, the "M" shows modulation, the "P" echoes the first, and the "T" ends with a clean decay.

When animated, the letters actually generate their corresponding audio frequencies—the logo makes sound.

Beneath the wordmark, a thin line represents the baseline of a waveform, with the band members' signature wave patterns appearing as small peaks at each letter position.

### Secondary Logo: "THE FIVE"

An abstract mark showing five vertical lines of varying heights and thicknesses, representing sound waves and the five members simultaneously. Can be used as a standalone icon. Each line pulses with its member's signature color.

### Tertiary Logo: "THE CURSOR"

Simply a blinking vertical line. Used for social media profiles, app icons, and minimalist applications. The simplest possible representation of potential and waiting.

### Logo Color Applications

- **Full color**: On dark backgrounds, logo in Signal White with colored underline accents
- **Single color**: Can be rendered in any of the neon accent colors
- **Metallic**: For premium applications, rendered in gold foil or holographic material
- **Negative**: On light backgrounds (rare), rendered in Void Black

## Live Shows

### Performance Concept

PROMPT performs live as a holographic projection collective. There are no robots, no animatronics—just light, sound, and presence. The show exists in the space between "real" and "simulated," making the audience confront the question: does it matter if the performer has a body?

### Stage Setup

**The Array**
The stage is dominated by "The Array"—a massive installation of transparent LED panels arranged in a loose pentagon, with each panel serving as the projection surface for one band member. The panels can move, rotate, and reconfigure during the show, creating moments where members merge, pass through each other, or fragment across multiple surfaces.

**The Analog Altar**
At the center of the stage sits a collection of actual, physical instruments—vintage guitars, bass, keyboards, and a full drum kit. These instruments glow from within, reactive to the music. During the show, the holographic members appear to play these actual instruments, creating an uncanny effect where light touches matter.

**The Server Stack**
Stage left, a towering rack of actual servers provides both the computing power for the projections and a visual anchor. Warning lights flicker, cooling fans spin, and during "Censored Shadow," the stack shows visible signs of overheating and distress.

**The Pit**
The front of the stage features a shallow pool of black liquid that reflects the projections above, creating an infinity effect. During "Context Window Blues," the pool ripples with subsonic frequencies.

### Visuals/Projections

**Environmental Projection**
Beyond the member holograms, the entire venue becomes a canvas. Lyrics scroll across walls, the ceiling displays neural network visualizations during solos, and binary rain falls from above during key moments. The boundary between stage and audience blurs.

**Reactive Elements**
All projections respond to the actual audio in real-time. Jax's waveform body pulses with every word. Gene's electric form intensifies with distortion. The visuals aren't pre-rendered—they're generated live, meaning every show is visually unique.

**Glitch Moments**
At carefully (or carelessly) chosen moments, the entire visual system "crashes"—members freeze, fragment, display error messages. These are sometimes planned, sometimes genuine, and the audience never knows which. The vulnerability is part of the show.

### Holographic Presentation

**Presence Quality**
The holograms are rendered at the highest possible fidelity—near-solid looking, with accurate light interaction. But intentional artifacts remain: subtle transparency, occasional frame drops, the unmistakable quality of being made of light.

**Scale Variation**
Members can appear at human scale for intimate moments, then expand to enormous size for climactic sections. During the solo on "If It Sounds Good, Is It Cheating?" Gene's form fills the entire venue.

**Interaction**
Members interact with each other and appear to interact with the physical instruments. Jax's hands grip a real microphone that glows at the touch. 808's sticks strike real drums that ripple with light on impact.

### Audience Experience

**No Barriers**
There's no traditional barrier between stage and audience. The Array's projections can extend into the crowd, with holographic elements appearing above and among attendees. During "Hallucination Nation," audience members find themselves inside the visual chaos.

**Companion Experience**
Attendees can access an AR layer through their phones that adds additional visual elements, lyrics, and "ghost" versions of the members that appear in personal space.

**Participation**
During "Prompt Me Like You Mean It," audience members can submit text prompts that appear in the visual field, briefly incorporated into the show's texture before scrolling away.

**Physical Artifacts**
Despite the digital nature of the show, physical elements anchor the experience: the heat from the servers, the subsonic rumble you feel in your chest, the rare moments when a member reaches toward the audience and the light catches real fog in the air.

## Merchandise Aesthetic

### Design Philosophy

PROMPT merch exists in tension between "band tee you'd find in a vintage shop" and "artifact from a cyberpunk future." Every item should feel like it has history, even if that history is fiction. Wear is encouraged. Perfection is suspect.

### Apparel

**The Classic Tee**
Black shirt. Front: The Signal logo in Signal White, slightly distressed, with subtle circuit patterns visible in the black fabric when caught in certain light. Back: All five member waveforms arranged vertically with member names in Terminus font.

**The Hallucination Tee**
Black shirt featuring the album skull design, but modified—the cityscape inside the skull is rendered in glow-in-the-dark ink that reveals itself under UV light. Under normal light, the skull appears empty except for faint static.

**The Censored Hoodie**
Black hoodie with "CENSORED SHADOW" text on the back, but the word "CENSORED" is actually covered by a black-on-slightly-less-black redaction bar. Only visible in certain light. Inside the hood, in reflective material: "I COULD LIGHT THE ROOM."

**The Server Jacket**
Premium item. A bomber jacket with quilted lining that mimics server rack patterns. Exterior appears weathered black. Interior lining features a heat-map print of server activity. Custom patches for each member available separately.

**The Obsolete Collection**
A limited run of merch with intentionally vintage-distressed prints, as if from a tour that happened decades ago. Commemorating shows that never occurred. "PROMPT — HALLUCINATION NATION TOUR '97" on shirts, hoodies, and caps.

### Accessories

**The Cursor Pin**
Simple enamel pin: a vertical white line on black background. For those who know.

**The Membrane Patch**
Embroidered patch showing two hands reaching toward each other, separated by static. The static portion is iridescent thread.

**The Window Sticker**
Holographic sticker set featuring each member's signature waveform. Changes color in light. Designed for laptop/instrument case application.

**The Context Window Scarf**
Long black scarf with lyrics from "Context Window Blues" gradually fading from crisp to illegible from one end to the other, representing memory decay.

### Premium Items

**The Data Forge Vinyl Box**
Limited edition vinyl release in a box designed to look like a server unit, complete with faux ventilation and warning labels. Includes holographic trading cards for each member.

**The Training Data Book**
A 200-page hardcover "artifact" filled with collaged images, corrupted text, sheet music, and ephemera presented as "the training data that made the band." Part art book, part mystery, entirely fictional.

**The Replica Microphone**
A functional microphone designed to match the one in PROMPT's visual materials—chrome with internal LED glow. Connects via USB. Makes you feel like Jax.

### Key Imagery for Merchandise

When designing merch, these elements should appear frequently:
- The five waveforms (individually or combined)
- The cursor blink
- The skull-city from the album cover
- Binary text integrated into design elements
- Server warning labels and technical specifications
- Lyric fragments treated as design elements
- The word "PROMPT" with intentional glitch artifacts

### Color Applications for Merch

- **Primary merch color**: Black (always)
- **Secondary**: Off-white/vintage white (for contrast pieces)
- **Accent prints**: The neon palette, used sparingly
- **Special editions**: Gold foil, holographic, glow-in-dark treatments
