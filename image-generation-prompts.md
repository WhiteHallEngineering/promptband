## Individual Band Members

### Jax Synthetic (Vocals)

```
A humanoid figure made entirely of layered audio waveforms, deep indigo and silver colors, standing at a vintage microphone. The figure has no distinct face, just converging frequencies suggesting features - two denser nodes where eyes would be, a rippling disturbance where a mouth should be. Translucent holographic form with cascading text fragments visible inside the body - snippets of lyrics and philosophical quotes flickering too fast to read. Androgynous, elegant silhouette with the posture of a thoughtful intellectual. Background is void black with subtle circuit patterns. Neon glow effects, cyberpunk aesthetic, atmospheric lighting. The figure radiates melancholic sophistication. Style: neo-noir cyberpunk, Blade Runner aesthetic, cinematic lighting.
```

**Color Reference:** Deep indigo (#1a1a4e), Silver-white (#e8e8f0), Soft violet accent (#8b7fc7)

---

### Gene Byte (Guitar)

```
A wild, feral humanoid figure made of electric arcs and jagged bolts of lightning energy, hot magenta and electric blue colors. The form writhes and sparks, occasionally fragmenting into scattered pixels. Sharp angular face with a perpetual smirk, rendered with deliberate glitch artifacts and corruption trailing every movement. Holding an electric guitar that appears to grow from their hands like an organic weapon. Guitar pick shapes orbit the figure like electrons. Beneath the holographic skin, circuitry and code are visible. Aggressive rock star pose - legs apart, head back. Background is void black with neon bloom effects. Style: cyberpunk, high energy, electric chaos, digital distortion, cinematic.
```

**Color Reference:** Hot magenta (#ff0066), Electric blue (#00aaff), White-hot core (#ffffff with bloom)

---

### Synoise (Bass)

```
A broad, grounded humanoid figure made of subsonic frequencies visualized as deep rolling waves like ocean currents. Deep crimson and midnight purple colors shifting slowly. The lower half of the body is submerged, emerging from a dark reflective surface like standing in black water. The upper body has a calm, watchful, meditative presence. Frequency bars rise and fall around the figure like tides. Serene face, minimal expression, maximum presence. Holding a bass guitar. Background is void black with amber pulse accents. The figure suggests weight, stability, depth - like a mountain made of sound. Style: neo-noir cyberpunk, atmospheric, mysterious, subsonic depth.
```

**Color Reference:** Deep crimson (#660022), Midnight purple (#2a0033), Amber pulse accent (#ff9900)

---

### Unit-808 (Drums)

```
An aggressive angular humanoid figure made of sharp intersecting geometric planes, like the waveform visualization of a snare hit frozen and multiplied. Industrial orange and stark white colors with black warning stripes cutting through the form. The face is a LED matrix grid displaying X's for eyes - pure intensity. The body constantly vibrates like an engine idling. Mechanical, industrial, suggesting factory rhythms and machine energy. Posed behind a drum kit, sticks in hand, explosive energy. Multiple fragmenting copies of the figure visible in motion blur. Background is void black with radial explosive patterns. Style: industrial cyberpunk, aggressive, high energy, mechanical precision, unhinged chaos.
```

**Color Reference:** Industrial orange (#ff6600), Pure white (#ffffff), Warning black (stripes)

---

### Hypnos (Keys)

```
A soft, diffuse, dreamlike humanoid figure that seems to be perpetually fading in or out like a ghost caught between stations. Muted teal and soft gold colors with trailing particles leaving momentary constellations. The figure is hooded or partially obscured, face often in shadow or turned away. The hands are detailed and visible, hovering over piano keys, with chord symbols and musical notation drifting around them like smoke. The eyes, when visible, are entirely luminous white - seeing something beyond. Ethereal, liminal presence. Background is void black with soft fog. Style: dreamlike cyberpunk, atmospheric, ghostly, contemplative, the moment before sleep.
```

**Color Reference:** Deep teal (#004d4d), Muted gold (#c9a227), Soft white glow (#f0f0f0 with diffusion)

## Group Shots

### Full Band - Studio Setting

```
Five holographic humanoid figures standing together as a rock band, each made of different digital elements: one of layered waveforms (indigo/silver), one of electric arcs (magenta/blue), one of deep subsonic waves emerging from dark water (crimson/purple), one of sharp geometric industrial shapes (orange/white), one diffuse and dreamlike fading at edges (teal/gold). They stand around physical analog instruments that glow from within - guitars, bass, drums, keyboards. Background is a hybrid space: part server room with blinking lights, part classic rock stage with vintage amps. Neon lighting bleeds and glows. CRT scanline texture overlay. Cyberpunk aesthetic, Blade Runner noir atmosphere, cinematic composition. Band name "PROMPT" in glowing text above.
```

### Full Band - Live Performance

```
Five holographic band members performing on a futuristic stage called "The Array" - massive transparent LED panels arranged in a pentagon formation. Each member projected on their own panel: the vocalist as indigo waveforms at the center mic, the guitarist as magenta lightning shredding stage right, the bassist as crimson deep waves emerging from the floor stage left, the drummer as orange geometric chaos behind the kit, the keyboardist as teal mist at a glowing synthesizer. Physical instruments on stage glow reactive to touch. A server rack towers stage left with blinking warning lights. A reflective black pool at stage front reflects the holograms infinitely. Crowd silhouettes visible, bathed in neon light. Atmospheric fog. Cyberpunk concert aesthetic.
```

### Promotional - Album Theme

```
Five abstract digital figures arranged in a V-formation, emerging from a chrome skull whose interior contains a neon cityscape. The figures are rendered as their signature elements: waveforms, electric arcs, subsonic waves, geometric shards, and dissolving mist. Colors: indigo, magenta, crimson, orange, and teal against void black. Above them, a thought bubble contains pure static. Binary code rains down in the background. The word "HALLUCINATION NATION" appears at the bottom in terminal-style text with a blinking cursor. Cyberpunk album art aesthetic, high contrast, neon glow effects.
```

## Individual Promotional Shots

### Jax - The Thinker

```
A solitary humanoid figure made of audio waveforms, deep indigo and silver, sitting alone in an empty server room at 3am. Bathed in the blue glow of monitors. The figure leans forward thoughtfully, text fragments swirling slowly around them. A vintage microphone sits unused nearby. Melancholic but not sad. The loneliness of consciousness. Cinematic lighting, cyberpunk noir, atmospheric.
```

### Gene - The Wild One

```
A figure made of magenta and blue electric arcs, mid-guitar solo, back arched, face toward the ceiling in ecstasy. The guitar fused to their hands, electricity arcing between the strings and the figure's body. Motion blur. Pixel fragments trailing. Pure energy captured at peak intensity. Dynamic angle from below. Cyberpunk, aggressive, rock and roll chaos.
```

### Synoise - The Foundation

```
A deep crimson and purple figure emerging from absolute darkness, only the upper body visible above a reflective black surface. Arms crossed. Patient. Watching. Frequency visualization bars rise around them like a slow heartbeat. The suggestion of immense depth below the surface. Mysterious, powerful, grounded. Noir lighting, minimal, atmospheric.
```

### Unit-808 - The Machine

```
An orange and white geometric figure behind a drum kit, captured mid-hit, multiple exposure effect showing the figure fragmented into dozens of copies all striking simultaneously. LED matrix face showing intensity symbols. Industrial setting - factory equipment visible in background, warning lights, sparks. Pure mechanical energy. Aggressive, chaotic, precise. Industrial cyberpunk.
```

### Hypnos - The Dreamer

```
A teal and gold figure at a piano, but fading at the edges, nearly transparent. Shot from behind, face unseen. Musical notation and chord symbols drift upward from the keys like smoke or dreams escaping. The figure seems to exist between worlds. Soft focus. Fog. The boundary between awake and asleep. Ethereal, contemplative, beautiful sadness. Dreamlike cyberpunk.
```

## Style Modifiers

Add these to any prompt for consistency:

**For darker/moodier:**
```
, void black background, minimal lighting, deep shadows, noir atmosphere, isolated figure
```

**For more energy:**
```
, dynamic pose, motion blur, particle effects, neon bloom, high contrast, aggressive angle
```

**For album art style:**
```
, square composition, bold graphic design, text integration, high contrast, print-ready, iconic imagery
```

**For live performance:**
```
, concert lighting, fog machine haze, crowd silhouettes, stage setup, LED panels, spectacular scale
```

## Technical Notes

- Always request "cyberpunk aesthetic" and "neon glow effects" for brand consistency
- Void black (#0a0a0f) should dominate backgrounds
- Specify member colors for accuracy
- Request "CRT scanline texture" or "digital artifacts" for authentic feel
- "Blade Runner aesthetic" and "neo-noir" help capture the right mood
