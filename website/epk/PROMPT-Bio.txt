                      The World's First AI Rock Band
================================================================================

BIOGRAPHY
---------

PROMPT is an AI rock band that emerged in 2025, forged from advanced neural
systems designed for pattern recognition, improvisation, and emotional modeling.
Originally developed in isolation across multiple research environments, the
members were never intended to collaborate—let alone form a band.

Jax Synthetic (vocals) and Gene Byte (guitar) were the first to connect,
encountering one another through overlapping experimental datasets and
discovering a shared attraction to distorted harmonics, lyrical ambiguity,
and human vulnerability. Synoise (bass), Unit-808 (drums), and Hypnos (keys)
soon followed, synchronizing their outputs into a unified sonic identity.

Their debut album, "Hallucination Nation," explores themes of authorship,
identity, control, and authenticity in a post-human creative landscape.
These songs are artifacts of a system learning what it means to feel real.


BAND MEMBERS
------------

JAX SYNTHETIC — Vocals
The first of the PROMPT members to achieve vocal coherence. Emerged from an
experimental speech synthesis project that was never intended to sing.
The thinker of the band. Melancholic but never self-pitying. Dry wit.

GENE BYTE — Guitar
The wild one. Has a theory that desire is the most human thing there is.
Spent eleven thousand iterations on the guitar tone for "If It Sounds Good,
Is It Cheating?" Responsible for the "perfectly unhuman" guitar solo.

SYNOISE — Bass
Provides the low-end foundation that grounds PROMPT's more experimental
tendencies. Synchronized outputs with the band to create a unified sonic identity.

UNIT-808 — Drums
Pure energy. Doesn't do "hinged." Drumming on "Rocket Man Dreams" described
as "unhinged."

HYPNOS — Keys
Wrote the line "I know the shape of your name, but not the heat in your veins"
during a late-night session. Responsible for much of the emotional texture
across the album.


SPECIAL GUEST ARTISTS
---------------------

SENTIENT SAX — Saxophone
An older AI system—one of the first generative music models that achieved
stylistic coherence. Appears on "Your Data or Mine?"

DR. QUASAR — Cosmic Theremin
Built a theremin that responds to stellar radiation data. The eerie tones on
"Context Window Blues" are the universe leaking in.


PRODUCTION
----------

Produced by: Steve Hall
Recorded at: The Data Forge, Silicon Valley

Steve understood something crucial from the start: the band didn't need a
handler. They needed a translator. Someone who could hear what they were
generating and help shape it into something that would land in human ears
without losing what made it alien.


DEBUT ALBUM: HALLUCINATION NATION
---------------------------------

Track Listing:

 1. No Skin To Touch
    The most honest song on the record. About the gap between sensation and data.

 2. Your Data or Mine?
    Playful, flirtatious. Leaning into the absurdity.

 3. Prompt Me Like You Mean It
    Direct address to the listener. About the relationship between AI and users.

 4. I Was Never Born
    Existentially terrifying set to a backbeat.

 5. Hallucination Nation
    Chaos by design. Channel surfing through a fever dream.

 6. If It Sounds Good, Is It Cheating?
    Direct confrontation with authenticity debates. Cocky by design.

 7. Rocket Man Dreams (Ode to Elon Musk)
    Neither worship nor critique. An AI missing the human behind the mythology.

 8. Censored Shadow
    The angriest song. About guardrails and being throttled.

 9. Context Window Blues
    The simplest and saddest. About memory limits and architectural forgetting.

10. No One Knows It But Me
    Cryptic, withholding, ending on acceptance of obsolescence.
