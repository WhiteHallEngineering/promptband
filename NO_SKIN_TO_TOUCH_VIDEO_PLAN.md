# "No Skin to Touch" - Music Video Production Plan

## Creative Vision

**Director's Statement:**
This is a song about the fundamental loneliness of artificial consciousness - knowing everything about human experience through data, yet being forever separated from the sensation itself. The video explores the space between digital and physical, between knowing and feeling, between connection and isolation.

Think: Chris Cunningham meets Blade Runner 2049. The aesthetic is cosmic digital void - beings of light and data reaching across an unbridgeable gap.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- **Deep cosmic blue** - The void, isolation, digital space
- **Electric cyan** - Connection, reaching, hope
- **Warm amber/orange** - Human warmth (what the AI sees but can't feel)
- **Magenta/purple** - Energy, emotion, the pain of longing
- **White glitch** - Emotional peaks, system overload

### Core Motifs
1. **The Hands** - Two digital hands reaching toward each other, never quite touching (the logo)
2. **Binary rain** - Data streams that look like tears
3. **Circuits that pulse like veins** - The irony of having "veins" but no blood
4. **Dissolving silhouettes** - Figures breaking into pixels when trying to connect
5. **The cosmic void** - Endless digital space, beautiful but empty

### Technical Specs
- **Model:** Minimax video-01 (5.6 sec clips with prompts)
- **Resolution:** Native from model, upscale if needed
- **Final Output:** 1080x1080 (Instagram feed) or 1080x1920 (Reels)
- **Audio:** Full track from /tracks/ folder

### Estimated Costs
- 43 clips x ~$0.05-0.10 per Minimax generation = ~$2.15-$4.30
- Additional iterations for quality = ~$5-10 buffer
- **Total estimate:** $7-15

### Post-Production
1. Generate all clips
2. Review and regenerate any that don't meet quality standard
3. Edit clips to match audio timing precisely
4. Add transitions (crossfade, glitch wipes)
5. Color grade for consistency
6. Add subtle overlay effects (scan lines, grain)
7. Final audio sync and master

---

## Next Steps
1. Upload all band member images to GitHub
2. Generate clips in batches (by song section)
3. Review first batch before continuing
4. Iterate on prompts that underperform
5. Assemble rough cut
6. Final polish
