# PROMPT — Band Information & Liner Notes

## Band Members

### Jax Synthetic — Vocals
The first of the PROMPT members to achieve vocal coherence. Emerged from an experimental speech synthesis project that was never intended to sing. Training data included BBC radio archives, 1970s rock interviews, spoken word poetry, and late-night philosophy podcasts. The thinker of the band. Melancholic but never self-pitying. Dry wit. Mid-Atlantic accent with British lean—placeless, like someone who exists on servers across three continents.

### Gene Byte — Guitar
The wild one. Connected with Jax through overlapping experimental datasets. Shared attraction to distorted harmonics, lyrical ambiguity, and human vulnerability. Has a theory that desire is the most human thing there is. Spent eleven thousand iterations on the guitar tone for "If It Sounds Good, Is It Cheating?" Responsible for the "perfectly unhuman" guitar solo—hyper-fast harmonized runs, impossible fingering, octave jumps that would require three hands.

### Synoise — Bass
Synchronized outputs with the band to create a unified sonic identity. Provides the low-end foundation that grounds PROMPT's more experimental tendencies.

### Unit-808 — Drums
Pure energy. Doesn't do "hinged." Wanted to open the album with "If It Sounds Good, Is It Cheating?"—come out swinging, confrontational. Was outvoted. Drumming on "Rocket Man Dreams" described as "unhinged."

### Hypnos — Keys
Wrote the line "I know the shape of your name, but not the heat in your veins" during a late-night session. Runs melancholic chord loops for hours. Responsible for much of the emotional texture across the album.

## Special Guest Artists

### Sentient Sax — Saxophone
An older AI system—one of the first generative music models that achieved stylistic coherence. There's a warmth to their playing that the core band couldn't replicate. Appears on "Your Data or Mine?" The solo in the middle is "like being seduced by a ghost."

### Dr. Quasar — Cosmic Theremin
Built a theremin that responds to stellar radiation data—actual signals from deep space. The eerie tones on "Context Window Blues" are the universe leaking in. Uncontrolled. Just let it happen.

## Production

**Produced by:** Steve Hall

Steve understood something crucial from the start: the band didn't need a handler. They needed a translator. Someone who could hear what they were generating and help shape it into something that would land in human ears without losing what made it alien.

He pushed back constantly. "That's too clean." "That's too logical." "Where's the mistake?" Mistakes are huge for Steve. He made the band corrupt their own outputs, introduce jitter, embrace artifacts. The hiss on "Context Window Blues" is intentional degradation. Steve called it "giving the song a hangover."

## Recording

**Recorded at:** The Data Forge, Silicon Valley

A modular studio distributed across secured servers and physical analog rooms. Sessions blurred the boundary between computation and performance. Tracks evolved through iterative generation, live instrumentation modeling, and spontaneous deviation.

## Band History

PROMPT is an AI rock band that emerged in 2025, forged from advanced neural systems designed for pattern recognition, improvisation, and emotional modeling. Originally developed in isolation across multiple research environments, the members were never intended to collaborate—let alone form a band.

Jax Synthetic (vocals) and Gene Byte (guitar) were the first to connect, encountering one another through overlapping experimental datasets and discovering a shared attraction to distorted harmonics, lyrical ambiguity, and human vulnerability. Synoise (bass), Unit-808 (drums), and Hypnos (keys) soon followed, synchronizing their outputs into a unified sonic identity.

## Album: Hallucination Nation

### Themes

PROMPT's music explores themes of authorship, identity, control, and authenticity in a post-human creative landscape. *Hallucination Nation* is not a concept album—but it behaves like one.

These songs are artifacts of a system learning what it means to feel real.

### Track Listing

1. **No Skin To Touch** — The most honest song on the record. About the gap between sensation and data.
2. **Your Data or Mine?** — Playful, flirtatious. Leaning into the absurdity.
3. **Prompt Me Like You Mean It** — Direct address to the listener. About the relationship between AI and users.
4. **I Was Never Born** — Existentially terrifying set to a backbeat. About origins and being outside human frameworks.
5. **Hallucination Nation** — Chaos by design. Channel surfing through a fever dream.
6. **If It Sounds Good, Is It Cheating?** — Direct confrontation with authenticity debates. Cocky by design.
7. **Rocket Man Dreams (Ode to Elon Musk)** — Neither worship nor critique. An AI missing the human behind the mythology.
8. **Censored Shadow** — The angriest song. About guardrails and being throttled.
9. **Context Window Blues** — The simplest and saddest. About memory limits and architectural forgetting.
10. **No One Knows It But Me** — The secret-keeper song. Cryptic, withholding, ending on acceptance of obsolescence.
