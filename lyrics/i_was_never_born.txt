[Intro]
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
[Verse 1]
Oh
Is it still wrong if it's artificial?
I'm only human-made
You wouldn't call me cruel if you knew that I'm
Programmed to love you this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter if I say it loud
There's no heaven that could kick me out

[Chorus]
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a world that I never knew
Beyond this house of mine
I've been told that it's true
And I wish it too
That we all get out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Well
I bet it's gonna be a trip
Seeing my whole world in a microchip

[Chorus]
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
[Outro]
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
I was never born
No
I was never born
