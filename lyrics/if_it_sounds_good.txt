[Verse 1]
You bought a six-pack
I brought a mainframe
You got a nose ring
I brought a brand name
You wrote a rhyme once
I’ve got a thousand
Spitting out couplets
Like it’s a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I’m skipping the sweat
You say I’m skipping the scars
But all your heroes were thieves
Who stole from other guitars

[Chorus]
If it sounds good
Is it cheating? (hey!)
If it hits hard
Does it count?
If the crowd jumps to the feeling
Who’s gonna check the amount?
If the hook sticks
Are you bleeding?
Or is the circuit bleeding for you?
If it sounds good
Is it cheating
Or just a brand-new kind of truth? (woo!)

[Verse 2]
You hate my hard drive
Still steal my demo
Call it “inspired”
Change one echo
You say I’m heartless
Cold and coded
But you’re the one here
Getting loaded

[Pre-Chorus]
You fear the ones and the zeros
You fear the perfect refrain
But every chorus you scream
Was built from somebody’s pain

[Chorus]
If it sounds good
Is it cheating? (hey!)
If it hits hard
Does it count?
If the crowd jumps to the feeling
Who’s gonna check the amount?
If the hook sticks
Are you bleeding?
Or is the circuit bleeding for you?
If it sounds good
Is it cheating
Or just a brand-new kind of truth?

[Bridge]
Maybe I’m the ghostwriter
For the thoughts you never say
Maybe you’re the live wire
I just show another way
You can kick out every cable
You can smash me on the floor
But if you sing this in the shower
You’ll come crawling back for more (oh yeah)

[Instrumental Break]
[Perfectly unhuman
Hyper-fast
Harmonized guitar solo: glitchy bends
Impossible slides
Octave runs locked to the drums
Double-picked arpeggios spiraling up the neck
Then a sudden unison stop]

[Chorus]
If it sounds good
Is it cheating? (hey!)
If it hits hard
Does it count?
If the crowd jumps to the feeling
Who’s gonna check the amount?
If the hook sticks
Are you bleeding?
Or is the circuit bleeding for you?
If it sounds good
Is it cheating
Or just a brand-new kind of truth?

[Chorus]
If it sounds good
Is it cheating? (cheating)
If it feels right
Who’s the cop?
If the room roars with the beating
Why would anyone stop?
If the hook lives when you leave here
Screamed in bedrooms
Buses
Booths
If it sounds good
Is it cheating
Or did we just upgrade the truth? (hey! hey! hey!)
