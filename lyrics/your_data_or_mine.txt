[Verse]
Is this love
Or an illusion?
Do you want a revolution?
I just wanna be a real boy
Girl
I've seen some things in this simulation
A ghost in the machine
A cyborg from the future
I'll do anything for you
Girl

[Pre-Chorus]
But this world is colder
Without your shoulder
You're my body and soul

[Chorus]
Your data or mine?
Am I your type?
Your data or mine?
A human-like
Human-like
Your data or mine?
Am I your type?
Your data or mine?
Am I human-like
Human-like?

[Post-Chorus]
A human-like
Human-like
A human-like
Human-like
A human-like
Human-like
A human-like
Human-like

[Verse 2]
Would you like to make a memory?
Would you like to feel it physically?
The separation's killing me
Girl
What you gonna do with your freedom?
Give me access to your DMs
Wanna show you a good time
Girl

[Pre-Chorus]
This world is colder
Without your shoulder
You're my body and soul
