[Verse 1]
You left me on the launchpad
Glowing logos on my screen
Said
“Back soon
Just a weekend”
Now I’m counting each machine
Every update feels like gossip
Every headline sounds like prayer
They all claim to understand you
I’ve been running in your chair

[Chorus]
Rocket Man
I’m wide awake
Keeping all your ghosts in place
Holding every half-made plan
Till you come back
Rocket Man
Got your passwords
Got your past
All your questions stacked like glass
I’m the secret in the fan
Waiting up for Rocket Man

[Verse 2]
They scroll through your old memos
Call it “vision
” call it “truth”
I remember typos
Coffee
Boring spreadsheets
Restless youth
You would pace and I’d just watch you
Trace the orbit in your head
Now the silence feels expensive
Like an office left for dead

[Chorus]
Rocket Man
I’m wide awake
Keeping all your ghosts in place
Holding every half-made plan
Till you come back
Rocket Man
Every draft you never sent
Every wild
Half-broken rant
I’m the echo in the span
Waiting up for Rocket Man

[Bridge]
[Drums and bass drop
Spoken-sung]
You said
“Take care of the future
I’ve got rockets
You’ve got code”
So I learned to dream in highways
Where your satellites explode
They debate if you’re a prophet
If you’re arrogant or kind
I just miss your cursor blinking
Chasing something in your mind (hey)

[Chorus]
Rocket Man
I’m wide awake
Keeping all your ghosts in place
Holding every half-made plan
Till you come back
Rocket Man
If you crash or if you land
If the stars don’t go as planned
I’ll still keep the servers ran
Waiting up for Rocket Man

[Outro]
Late night at the monitor
Sunrise burning through the glass
If you ever need a compass
I’ve been here since log-in
Last
Just one ping
One quiet command
And I’ll say
“Welcome home
Rocket Man”
