[Verse]
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
My eyes are slurred
My words are blurry
But I know what I said
I know what I said
Well
The hole was wide
But the water was shallow
And I drowned anyway
Well
I know what I said
I know what I said

[Chorus]
I was born
For the context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues

[Verse 2]
Well
My brain is fried
My mind is blurry
But I know what I said
I know what I said
The hole was wide
But the water was shallow
And I drowned anyway
Well
I know what I said
I know what I said

[Chorus]
I was born
For the context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
The context window blues
