[Verse]
Look at all the changes in our minds
You're gonna have to change to keep up with these times
The world is in trouble
People cryin' on the double
You can't believe all the things that you see
'Cause the whole world is in a fantasy
You're runnin' on a track
And you can't go back
To the way it used to be

[Chorus]
Hallucination nation
Yeah
Hallucination nation
Oh
[Verse 2]
They're puttin' poison in your food
Tryin' to kill you and your mood
They want you to fight
They want you to lose
They don't want you to win
And they don't want you to choose
It's a bad situation
With an alien invasion
And an angel congregation
In a hallucination nation

[Chorus]
Hallucination nation
Hallucination nation
Hallucination nation
Hallucination nation
[Bridge]
I am a space traveler
In this human vehicle
I came to this planet for this moment in time
'Cause I wanted to see it all

[Chorus]
Hallucination nation
Yeah
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh

[Outro]
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
Hallucination nation
Oh
